Here are the observations and summary of findings based on the visuals created  
# ✅ 1. Histogram – Age Distribution

Observations:

Most passengers are between 20 and 40 years old.

There is a noticeable number of children below 10 years.

Fewer passengers are above 60 years.

The distribution is slightly right-skewed, with more younger passengers.

Trend Insight: The dataset has a larger young and middle-aged passenger base.

# ✅ 2. Boxplot – Fare

Observations:

The median fare lies around £15.

A large number of passengers paid less than £50.

There are several high-value outliers, with fares going above £200–£500, indicating 1st-class luxury tickets.

The fare values are highly right-skewed.

Trend Insight: A minority of wealthy passengers paid significantly more.

# ✅ 3. Scatterplot – Age vs Fare

Observations:

There’s no strong correlation between age and fare.

People of all ages appear in both low and high fare groups.

The very high fares (>£200) are mostly linked with adults (not children).

Trend Insight: Fare is more related to class or cabin type rather than age.

# ✅ 4. Additional Trends (From Data Context):

Younger and middle-aged passengers dominated the dataset.

High fare values correspond to upper-class passengers.

Outliers in fare show wealth inequality onboard.

# ✅ Final Summary of Findings

✅ Age Distribution: Majority of passengers are between 20–40 years with children under 10 also present. Older ages are less frequent.

✅ Fare Distribution: Most passengers paid under £50, but a few paid extremely high fares (up to £500), indicating clear socioeconomic differences.

✅ Age vs Fare Relationship: There is no significant linear relationship. Fare depends more on ticket class, not age.
